## Project Description
This is an interactive educational interface for children to learn about electromagnetic forces in simple language without scientific terms. The project is based on the concept of "magical glue" (דבקסם) that explains electromagnetic phenomena through the metaphor of moving spheres.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, simple variable names in Hebrew when appropriate for educational content
- Write comments in Hebrew for educational explanations
- Focus on visual and interactive elements suitable for children
- Use modern JavaScript ES6+ features
- Keep code modular and well-organized
- Prioritize performance for smooth animations

## Educational Concepts to Implement
- Visual representation of atoms as "spheres" (גולות)
- Interactive microscope simulation
- Temperature as movement visualization
- State changes (solid, liquid, gas) through sphere movement
- Magnetic attraction concepts through simple metaphors

## Technical Requirements
- Use Canvas for interactive visualizations
- Implement smooth animations
- Create responsive design for various screen sizes
- Ensure accessibility for children
- Use modern CSS for beautiful UI
